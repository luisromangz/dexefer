**Update April 2014: The code was never complete (as the project supporting its development was cancelled) so although the basics are there, making it wourk would need improving this codebase, so use it at your own risk.**

**If you are interested in improving the code, propose yourself as a commiter. The world NEEDS an easy DXF writing library for Java**


The Dexefer project is intended as a Java, annnotation driven library for writing DXF without a prior knowledge of the format.

All low-level command output is done by the library, so the programmer just need to define the drawing itself.
